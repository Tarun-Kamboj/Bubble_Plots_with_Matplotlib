A bubble plot is a variation of the scatter plot that displays three dimensions of data (x, y, z). The datapoints are replaced with bubbles, and the size of the bubble is determined by the third variable 'z', also known as the weight. In maplotlib, we can pass in an array or scalar to the keyword s to plot(), that contains the weight of each point.

In the notebook provided, i've shown you how to create delicious bubble plots using `matplotlib` as shown below.
